The Representation Fallacy

	Philosophy

		-
			The representation fallacy is the tendency to assume that negative traits or behaviors
			displayed by an individual apply to or represent a group that said individual belongs
			to.

			Any group percieved as an out group, such as minorities, are especially seceptible to
			this, even more so if there is pre-existing resentment against said group by the
			observer.
