Falsifiability and Verifiabity

	Philosophy

		-
			Falsifiable claims are objective claims that are by definition either true or false.

			Verifiable claims are falsifiable claims for which their truth, or lack thereof, can be
			verified by observation.

			Non-falsifiable claims are subjective claims that cannot be said to be true or false.

			Non-verifiable claims are either falsifiable claims for which their truth, or lack
			thereof, cannot be verified by observation, or non-falsifiable claims.

		Scope of Disciplines

				of philosophy alone to analyze non-falsifiable claims.
