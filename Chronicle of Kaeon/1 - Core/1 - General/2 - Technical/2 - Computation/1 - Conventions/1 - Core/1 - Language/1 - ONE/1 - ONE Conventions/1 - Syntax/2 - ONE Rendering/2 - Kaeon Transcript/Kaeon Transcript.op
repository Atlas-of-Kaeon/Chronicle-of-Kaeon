Kaeon Transcript

	Philosophy

		-
			A Kaeon transcript is a ONE rendered document in the form of a Kaeon document derived
			from a document meant to be read directly by users.
		-

	Principles

		Conventions

			Structure

				-
					The title element of the document shall contain the title of the work.

					The philosophy section of the document shall reiterate the title of the
					document and specify other relevant metadata, including, but not limited to,
					the author and version of the work, if applicable.

					The content of the work shall be contained entirely within the principles
					section of the document.
				-

			Basic Conversion

				-
					It is standard practice with Kaeon transcripts to take every newline delineated
					block of text from the source document and to place it into an element, and to
					nest said elements such that the resulting structure of the document mirrors
					the hierarchy of the source document.
				-

			Notation

				-
					It is standard practice with Kaeon transcripts to nest each element with no
					children, or content elements, within another element containing only said
					content element, called item elements, and to nest item elements within
					elements which specify sections, called section elements, and to nest section
					elements either within other section elements or within the principles element.

					The content of a section or item block shall begin with the content of its
					parent, followed by a colon, followed by a space, followed by a string rendered
					according to the following paradigm:

					This string shall start with the name of the type of section or item that the
					element corresponds to, followed by a space, followed by the numerical index of
					the element. If the section to which the element corresponds has a specific
					name, the aforementioned string shall be followed with a space, followed by a
					hyphen, followed by said name.

					If a given Kaeon transcript does not match perfectly to this paradigm, it
					should strive to abide by it as closely as possible.
