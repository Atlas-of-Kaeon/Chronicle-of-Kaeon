Dual Log System

	Philosophy

		-
			The dual log system is the use of two types of documentation for handling task
			management, the ordered log and the chaotic log.

			The ordered log is a formal agile task board, and the chaotic log is a note board where
			any idea may be written as it comes into one's stream of consciousness. The chaotic log
			may be used to filter ideas into the ordered log.
